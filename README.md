# geo_spatial_explorations
geo_spatial_explorations is a summary of what I did in cleair start-up, one of the interesting skills I learned was plotting and analyzing spatial pollution data using python. 
Later I also developed geospatial APIs for the server frontend. I implemented concepts like 
- Geopandas plots and explore
- Shapely point and polygon
- Folium plots 
- Boundary extraction using OSM nominatim API
- Geojson to geopandas and plot
- Voronoi tessellation 
- H3 cells tessellation
- IDW spatial interpolation 
- Geospatial and temporal plots to show hyper-local air pollution on a city map in a 2 km H3 cell 
- Lastly, I developed an algorithm where I showed real-time pollution exposure of an individual from point A to point B using open routing, IDW, and h3 cell.

If you find this interesting you can connect and discuss it.

Some of the interesting plots are below, all of these were avilable as an endpoint on product UI.
