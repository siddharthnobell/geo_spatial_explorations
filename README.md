# geo_spatial_explorations
geo_spatial_explorations is a summary of what I did in cleair startup, one of interesting skill I learned was plotting and analyszing pollution data using python. Later I also developed geospatial apis to server frontend. I impletemted concepts like 
- Geopandas plots and explore
- Shaply point and polygon
- Folium plots 
- Boundary extraction using OSM nominatim api
- Geojson to geopandas and plot
- Veronoi tessilation 
- H3 cells 
- IDW spatial intepolation 
- Geospatial and tempotal plots to show hyper local air pollution on a city map in 2 km H3 cell 
- Lastly I developed a alogorithim where I showed real time pollution exposure of an individual from point A to point B using open routing, IDW and h3 cell.

If you find this interesting you can connect and discuss.

Some of the interesting plots are below, all of these were avilable as an endpoint on product UI.
